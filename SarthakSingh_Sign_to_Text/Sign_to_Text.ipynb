        "*   **Core Library Installation:** `streamlit-1.53.0` and `streamlit-webrtc-0.64.5` were successfully installed, along with various dependencies, setting up the necessary environment for the web dashboard.\n",
        "*   **Dependency Conflict Noted:** During installation, a dependency conflict was identified where `cryptography` (updated to `46.0.3`) and `pyopenssl` (updated to `25.3.0`) were incompatible with an existing `pydrive2` package, which requires older versions. While the core libraries were installed, this conflict was highlighted.\n",
        "*   **Refactored Recognition Logic:** The sign language recognition logic was successfully encapsulated into a reusable Python function, `process_video_frame`, within `sign_language_project/sign_language_recognition.py`. This function takes a video frame, processes it with MediaPipe for hand landmark detection, predicts a sign using a pre-loaded model, and returns the annotated frame and the detected sign text.\n",
        "*   **Streamlit Dashboard Development:** A `streamlit` application (`app.py`) was developed, integrating the `streamlit-webrtc` component for real-time webcam access and using the refactored `process_video_frame` function to process live video streams.\n",
        "*   **Real-time Display:** The Streamlit dashboard successfully displays processed video frames with MediaPipe hand landmarks and shows the detected sign in real-time. The application provides user feedback on webcam activity and detected signs.\n",
        "*   **Deployment Instructions:** Comprehensive instructions were provided for running the Streamlit application in a Colab environment and exposing it via a public URL using `ngrok`, including `pyngrok` installation, `ngrok` authentication token setup, and background execution of the Streamlit app.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The created Streamlit dashboard offers a functional and interactive real-time sign language recognition tool, demonstrating a successful integration of MediaPipe, a machine learning model, and a web interface.\n",
        "*   The identified dependency conflict with `pydrive2` should be monitored; although it didn't prevent the current application from running, it might lead to issues if `pydrive2` is actively used or its functionality is required later.\n",
        "*   To enhance user experience, further steps could include improving the model's accuracy, expanding its sign vocabulary, and considering deployment methods that simplify public access without requiring users to manually manage `ngrok` tokens.\n"
